👋 Hi, I'm Süleyman Toklu!
I'm a Computer Engineering student at Isparta University of Applied Sciences, passionate about machine learning, deep learning, and time series analysis. I love building data-driven solutions using Python, Java, and more. Here, you'll find my projects, experiments, and contributions to open-source!

🔍 What I Work On
Machine Learning: Regression, classification, and forecasting (Scikit-learn, Prophet).
Deep Learning: LSTM, CNN models with TensorFlow and Keras.
Time Series Analysis: Hybrid models like ARIMA-LSTM for predictions.
Software Development: Web apps (Streamlit) and automation systems (Java).

🌟 Featured Projects
Washington House Price Prediction: Built ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict house prices with 85% accuracy.
Time Series Forecasting with Hybrid Models: Combined Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTM for accurate forecasting.
Gold Price Analysis & Prediction System: A Streamlit web app for analyzing and predicting gold prices using ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.
Hospital Automation System: A Java-based system for patient and appointment management.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python, Java, C#, C++, Ruby
Frameworks/Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Unity
Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
